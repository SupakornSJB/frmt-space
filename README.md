## My process

### Built with

- [Angular](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I started this project wanted to mainly learn more about Angular and CSS.

I think I learned quite a lot of CSS concepts, but not so much more Angular since this project does not necessarily require much interactivity
